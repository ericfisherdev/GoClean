# GoClean Performance Benchmarks

This document provides comprehensive performance benchmarks for GoClean, demonstrating its ability to meet the performance targets outlined in the project specification.

## Performance Targets

Based on the project requirements, GoClean should achieve:

- **Scanning Speed**: >1000 files/second for typical Go projects
- **Memory Usage**: <100MB for projects with <10k files  
- **Report Generation**: <2 seconds for HTML output
- **Startup Time**: <500ms for CLI initialization

## Benchmark Overview

The benchmark suite tests performance across three main areas:

1. **Scanner Engine**: File parsing, AST analysis, and violation detection
2. **Violation Detectors**: Individual detector performance and accuracy
3. **Report Generation**: HTML, Markdown, and console output performance
